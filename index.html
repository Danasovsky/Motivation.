              </div> 
              <p class="webtxt">What I love about web development is that it is a growing and evolving sector. A world full of possibilities. There is no limit to the knowledge that can be gained and there is always a window of opportunity. Challenging tasks are daily on the menu and are addressed by innovative thinking combined with a hands-on mentality. Web development is a branch that celebrates diversity on multiple levels. Not only in terms of content, but also in terms of context and process. Web development requires a unique combination of logical, social, creative, environmental, and emotional thinking. For me, all these elements help create an environment that is beneficial to find joy and fulfillment in my work.

                <p class="txt3">I believe that learning by doing is a great way to learn a new skill. When you are immersed in a practical learning process, you quickly learn from your mistakes and rise above them. There is nothing as stimulating as experiencing progress on a daily basis.

Their initiative helps people like me to integrate back into the job market with a backpack full of high in-demand skills.

              <p class="webtxt4">This website was created as a part of my application for BeCode's web development training. It was a way for me to explore coding on a whole new level. My first experience with code was at the early ages of the internet when you still needed HTML to style your online text. With the arrival of the text editor, coding to me was a way of the past. It was only recently that I was reminded of this when I participated in BeCode's HTML and CSS workshop. That was the moment when my curiosity for code changed into an active pursuit. The more I get into it, the more I want to get into it even more. It definitely stimulates my hunter-gatherer mind, which is funny because in that workshop someone called HTML a sandwich. #codingisfun â™¥
